            <p>
                I am a passionate and driven B.Tech student at Newton School of Technology, ADYPU, Pune, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a strong foundation in Python programming, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I actively engage in competitive programming, honing my problem-solving skills through real-world challenges. 
                Securing an impressive JEE Advanced rank of 5142, I have demonstrated my academic excellence and ability to master complex concepts under pressure. 
                Beyond academics, I have a deep-rooted passion for sports, having represented my state in football and athletics, where I developed strong leadership, teamwork, and perseverance. 
                My exposure to entrepreneurship, team communication, and collaborative projects has further strengthened my ability to work effectively in dynamic environments. Always eager to learn and innovate, I am excited to apply my technical expertise and analytical mindset to solve real-world problems and drive impactful solutions. 🚀
